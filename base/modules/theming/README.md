## System-wide visual and UI resources.

- This directory contains configuration for visual resources that are shared across users and desktops, such as:

- Fonts

- Console appearance

- Cursor themes or fontconfig defaults

These modules provide the foundation for theming but do not define user preferences or desktop-specific styling.
