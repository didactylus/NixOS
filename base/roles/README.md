## Composable system roles.

Roles bundle multiple base modules into cohesive system profiles such as workstations, gaming systems, or servers.

A role typically:

- Imports modules from base/modules/

- Sets sane defaults for a specific use case

- Avoids host-specific or user-specific configuration

Hosts select roles to define what kind of system they are
