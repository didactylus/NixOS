## Networking stack and connectivity policy.

This directory contains modules related to network configuration and control, including:

- Network managers (NetworkManager, systemd-networkd)

- Firewall policy

- DNS resolution

- VPNs and overlays (e.g. Tailscale, WireGuard)

Modules here define how the system connects to and secures networks, not user-level SSH or application configs.
